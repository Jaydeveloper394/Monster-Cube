Major Bugs
The item collision is currently very wonky, and hard for the player to get a hang of.
Currently we’ve disabled the win condition since we haven’t implemented that part yet. 

Our game is built on interaction with objects inside the game, and our current design for the code doesn’t support that. We are planning on rewriting the interaction code so that it works with all items, not just items you can pick up. 

The added levels don’t have any lighting yet so it’s too dark for the players
The flashlight is not synced between players
